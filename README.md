# PYTHON Hackathon

## Challenge Tasks

**Functions & Fibonacci Sequence:** Write a Python program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term n. 
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1 and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

Your program should:

* Ask the user to input the value of n.

* Create a function that takes n as a parameter and returns a list containing the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

* Print the generated Fibonacci sequence.

**Python Conditional Statements:** Create a Python program that: 

* Prompts a user to enter their age.
  
* Uses a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.
  
* Prints You are eligible to vote if true, otherwise You are not eligible to vote

## Programs Included
Fibonacci Sequence Generator

Description: This Python program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. 

The program prompts the user to input the number of terms they want in the sequence, creates a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence, and prints the generated sequence.

How to Use:
* Run the program.
  
*Enter the desired number of terms for the Fibonacci sequence.

*The program will generate and display the Fibonacci sequence.

**Elections Card Game**

*Description:* The Elections Card Game is a Python program that simulates an election using a deck of cards. Players are dealt a hand of cards and take turns playing cards against the computer. 

The outcome of the election is determined by the ranks of the cards played. Players win the election by playing high-ranking cards.

*How to Play:*

* Run the program.
  
* Follow the prompts to input your age and determine eligibility.
  
* If eligible, play the game by choosing a card from your hand to play.
  
* The computer will randomly select a card to play.
  
*The election outcome will be displayed based on the ranks of the cards played.

**Guessing Game**

*Description:* The Number Guessing Game is a Python program where players attempt to guess a secret magic number chosen by the computer. 

Players have multiple attempts to guess the number correctly, and the computer provides feedback after each guess.

*How to Play:*

*Run the program.

*Input your guess to attempt to guess the secret magic number.

*Receive feedback from the computer based on your guess.

*Continue guessing until you either guess the magic number correctly or run out of attempts.
