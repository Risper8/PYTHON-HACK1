# Python Hackathon

**Hello Friend, Welcome to my Python Hackathon Repository**

Welcome to my Python Tasks repository! This repository contains Python programs that showcase various concepts such as functions, conditional statements, and more. Below are the details of the tasks and programs included in this repository.

## Challenge

Below are the tasks given for this challenge:

**Functions & Fibonacci Sequence:** Write a Python program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term n. 
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1 and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

Your program should:

* Ask the user to input the value of n.

* Create a function that takes n as a parameter and returns a list containing the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

* Print the generated Fibonacci sequence.

**Python Conditional Statements:** Create a Python program that: 

* Prompts a user to enter their age.
  
* Uses a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.
  
* Prints You are eligible to vote if true, otherwise You are not eligible to vote

### To add an intriguing twist to the learning experience, I've crafted engaging programs like the election and guess game programs. 

## Programs Included:

*Fibonacci Sequence:* Description: This Python program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. 

The program prompts the user to input the number of terms they want in the sequence, creates a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence, and prints the generated sequence.

*Conditional Statements:* This program prompts the user to enter their age and uses a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18. If the age is greater than or equal to 18, it prints "You are eligible to vote"; otherwise, it prints "You are not eligible to vote".

*Elections Card Game*: Description: The Elections Card Game is a Python program that replicates the experience of playing face cards in real life. It simulates an election using a standard deck of playing cards. Players are dealt a hand of cards and take turns playing cards against the computer. 

The outcome of the election is determined by the ranks of the cards played. Players win the election by playing high-ranking cards.

*Guessing Game*: Description: The Number Guessing Game is a Python program where players attempt to guess a secret magic number chosen by the computer. It's inspired by the classic coin toss game. 

Players have multiple attempts to guess the number correctly, and the computer provides feedback after each guess.

## **Usage:**

* Clone the repository to your local machine.

* Navigate to the directory of the desired program.

* Run the program using Dart SDK.
